# SPLICEApp Project Summary

The goal of this project is to find hidden smart devicea in any given home. A key assumption is that the hidden smart device is tagged with a special equipment, and the user downloaded our application to their mobile phone. That equipment will transmit BLE beacons and have an NFC tag on. The BLE beacon mode will alert the user's phone application that a smart device is present nearby. Once the user gets into a range, which is a preset RSSI level, the application will give the user the option to start scanning for the NFC tag. Once the tag is found, the location of the smart hidden device is now discovered.
